## Project Structure

The repository contains the following key files:

- `Bangalore_1990_2022_BangaloreCity.csv`: The primary dataset containing climate data for Bangalore.
- `DatasetAnalysis.ipynb`: Notebook for initial data exploration and analysis.
- `Arima&sarima.ipynb`: Implementation of ARIMA and SARIMA models for time series forecasting.
- `LSTM&BILSTM.ipynb`: Implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM models.
- `GRU.ipynb`: Implementation of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model.
- `Transformer.ipynb`: Implementation of Transformer model for time series forecasting.

## Models Implemented

The project explores various time series forecasting models:

- **ARIMA and SARIMA**: Traditional statistical models for time series analysis.
- **LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM**: Recurrent neural networks capable of learning long-term dependencies.
- **GRU**: A variant of RNN that is computationally efficient.
- **Transformer**: A model leveraging self-attention mechanisms, suitable for capturing complex patterns in time series data.

Each model's implementation is detailed in its respective notebook, including data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation metrics.
